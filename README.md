# UnityRPGFoolingAround

This is a project I'll be working on over the time. The game will start of as a base for me to fool around with and learn the basics of Unity in general. Afterwards I will adapt this game into my own likings, intending to make a game of my own desires with the knowledge learned through this guided project of a multitude of guides.
